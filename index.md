Beginner's Guide to Commands
============================

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/6%20minutes%2058%20seconds-estimated%20read%20time-green)  

This guide is unofficial, to be accompanied with the guide [here](https://gist.github.com/VideoCarp/eeaf915a2361d93f0fd8cf2c72d6db64).  
Firstly, since you're new I recommend **reading to full**.  
I know that this is quite long, but I mean it's useful, and it can be accompanied with my other guide. You can contact me [here](https://discord.gg/4stpKau)  

### What are commands?

* * *

Commands are bits of text that the game Minecraft understands, they can get quite advanced, but they're **easy** to pick up and learn.  

### Why commands?

* * *

Commands are pretty much the only way to create Minecraft content, without a real coding language, and they're pretty cool.  

### Beginning

* * *

Firstly I'm going to cover some logic, this is probably the **most important** part.  
There's a lot to cover, but I'm mostly going to be covering the beginner's basics.  
In Minecraft, there are 2 types of things, as I like to think of them. Those 2 things are entities and blocks.  
You might've heard of those a lot, and they're very important.  
  
**How to Read This** This is kinda written weird, don't skip over any headers, unless you have full certainty of them.

Basics
------

* * *

Here are some of the basics, read above for a bit of how to read this.

#### What is a block?

* * *

A block is essentially an object that takes up a 1x1 space . An example of a block would be say grass, dirt, etc.  
Everything in the below image is a block, don't worry about the water just yet.

#### What is an entity?

* * *

An entity as I like to think of it is any object that is not fixed to it's position, and can take damage.  
Water isn't fixed to it's position, is it an entity? No, the reason for that is because water cannot take damage.  
**All mobs, but not only mobs** are entities. Below is an example of an entity.

Now that you know what entities and blocks are, that's a step forward.  

### What is a syntax?

* * *

A quick explanation I'll give about syntaxes is that they're the format of the command, if your command doesn't  
execute, then there's a chance it's that. Give all syntax errors a full read, if they don't work, take reference  
from either my main guide or the `/help <command-name>` command while in game.  
An example of a syntax error is: `/kill @ e`. That specific one will be raised because there is a space between the  
`@` and the `e`. We'll go deeper into these `@` things in a bit. Below is an example of a syntax error.  
This most likely happened because the person didn't put an argument afterwards, but don't worry too much.  
![error example](https://i.ibb.co/y590bt1/D20-D2-B44-1-A2-E-4-DF9-BB91-9238320-F5-A4-C.jpg)

### How do I read a syntax?

* * *

Here's a quick sumnary, it isn't really accurate (I personally don't read them and somehow know it):

*   `<text_here>`. These brackets mean that this argument is **required**.
*   `[text_here]`. These brackets mean that this argument is **optional**.
*   `(option1 | option2)`. These brackets mean that this argument **must be one in the list**.
    
    Coordinate Management
    ---------------------
    

* * *

This is a crucial part in commands.

What are coordinates?
---------------------

* * *

To put it in my way, coordinates are really just the location of an object. But how do you know the coordinates?  
How are coordinates formatted? Well, regarding both of them, there are three [axes](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/axis), namely X, Y, and Z.  
**How are they formatted?**  
The X and Y axes should be clear, otherwise click on the hyperlink.  
Things start on the Z axis , that's what different, it's kind of like X, think of it as just another X, the reason  
for the existence of the Z axis is because the game is in 3D, don't worry too much about it for now.  
**How does one get the coordinates of an object?**  
It's quite simple to do this, you **do not need to teleport** yourself. You can simply run this command:  
`/gamerule showcoordinates true` and your coordinates should show **at the top left**. Once they're showing, read the numbers after  
`Position`. It should look somewhat like this: `Position: X, Y, Z`. If it doesn't show exactly like that, don't panic.  
X, Y, and Z are used to represent the number, whatever it is , is where your legs are . We'll be getting into  
tildes on the next section, they will be necessary.

### What are Tildes?

* * *

Tildes are the `~` character, which in English means **about**, **near**, or **here**.  
Same thing goes for coordinates in Minecraft.  
Each tilde in a command represents from where the command is being executed, and Math can be done on those.  
To add to the coordinate: `~<number>`. This goes for all X, Y, and Z axes.  
To remove from the coordinate: `~-<number>`. Note the `-`. This goes for all axes.  

Say you want the player to teleport 10 blocks upwards, remember the Y axis is vertical.  
`tp <target> ~ ~10 ~`.  
Now what is `target` you may ask. Target means the entity the command is being executed on.  
This command moves the player 10 blocks up from the command block if there is one, or the person who executed it.  
Don't worry yet about making the player do it, we'll cover it now.  

Entity Management
-----------------

* * *

Well this is a bad name for the section, but this section is for managing entities.  
There are a lot of commands that can affect entities, but here I'll cover the crucial ones.  

### Deleting an Entity

* * *

It's very easy to delete an entity, you can simply use the kill command to delete an entity.  
But what if you wanted to delete a dropped item, or perhaps a specific mob? Below is more info.  

### Targetting

* * *

You can use the target selector argument, which I will be specifying information about right here.  
You can use the `@e` targetting, but further than that is what we'll be focusing on.  
**@ Target Selectors**  
Now what are these? Well, I like to explain these as the main argument in selecting which entity to use.  
A list of each one of them, and what they do is below:

*   `@p` This selects the nearest player from where the command was executed.
*   `@r` This selects a random player in the world who is online.
*   `@s` This selects the **entity** that executed the command.
*   `@a` This selects all the players.
*   `@e` This selects all entites. `@s` is one I just wanna talk a bit more about. It makes the entity that executed be executed on.  
    

For example, I want a creeper to say `Aww man` in the chat, I'd use:  
`execute @e[type=creeper,name="creep.er"] ~ ~ ~ say Aww man`.  
You see those things in the `[]` brackets? They will be covered next.  

`@e[type=<entity_type>` will select a specific type of entity, this could be TNT, a dropped item, a  
specific mob type, etc, it can find any entity type. But what if you wanted a specific entity?  
`@e[type=<entity_type>,name=<name>`. With that, you'll find one of a name.  
A very common issue I find others doing is when they're getting the name, they usually  
forget to add quotes after the `=` sign. If the mob has a space in the name, simply  
instead of `<name>`, imagine it becomes `"<name>"`.  
The name may be ugly, and so here is an alternative, this is also a way to group entities. `/tag <target> (add | remove) <name: string>`.  
This will add a new group to the targetted entity, after adding it you can remove the name, if there is one.  
Now `string` means to add quotes, just like the name in the target selector.  
You may want to check for the range, here's how: `@e[r=<range number>]`  
In most guides, `number` will be represented as `int` or `integer`. They both mean a number.  
In the case of a decimal, it's considered `float`.

Execute
-------

* * *

**This is an extremely important section!** This section is fully dedicated to making entities execute a command, think of it as `sudo`, but for commands.  
The execute command is the **most powerful** command in the entire game, but don't worry, it isn't hard to  
pick up on. `/execute <target> <location> <selected command syntax>` is the syntax.  
The location argument will be discussed a bit below.  
`<selected command syntax>` refers to the command you're getting the entity to execute. I always have my location as `~ ~ ~` and when it's  
like that, it executes anywhere, that's at least what I use for myself.  
But what if you wanted to check if someone was on a specific block type?  
`/execute <target> <location> detect <block to detect> <data value> <detectPos> <command>`.  
That would be your syntax.  
`detect` isn't in brackets, this means to just put it there, regardless.  
Say you wanted a creeper walking on grass to kill nearby ocelots, you'd use this: `/execute @e[type=creeper] ~ ~ ~ detect grass 0 ~ ~-1 ~ kill @e[type=ocelot,r=5]`  

Now that you've gotten this far, I believe you're ready for my other guide, which has a contents panel.  
Click [here](https://gist.github.com/VideoCarp/eeaf915a2361d93f0fd8cf2c72d6db64).  
Also quick notice, use the power of effect, armor stands, tags and names.
