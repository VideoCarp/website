    <p>This guide is unofficial, to be accompanied with the guide <a href="https://gist.github.com/VideoCarp/eeaf915a2361d93f0fd8cf2c72d6db64">here</a>.<br>
        Firstly, since you&#39;re new I recommend <strong>reading to full</strong>.<br>
        I know that this is quite long, but I mean it&#39;s useful, and it can be accompanied with my other guide.

    <h3 id="what-are-commands-">What are commands?</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Commands are bits of text that the game Minecraft understands, 
      they can get quite advanced, but they&#39;re <strong>easy</strong> to pick up and learn.<br></p>
    <h3 id="why-commands-">Why commands?</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Commands are pretty much the only way to create Minecraft content, 
      without a real coding language, and they&#39;re pretty cool.<br></p>



    <h3 id="beginning">Beginning</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Firstly I&#39;m going to cover some logic, this is probably the <strong>most important</strong> part.<br>
        There&#39;s a lot to cover, but I&#39;m mostly going to be covering the beginner&#39;s basics.<br>
        In Minecraft, there are 2 types of things, as I like to think of them. Those 2 things are entities and blocks.<br>
        You might&#39;ve heard of those a lot, and they&#39;re very important.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>How to Read This</strong>
        This is kinda written weird, don&#39;t skip over any headers, unless you have full certainty of them.
    </p>


    <h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Here are some of the basics, read above for a bit of how to read this.</p>


    <h4 id="what-is-a-block-">What is a block?</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>A block is essentially <span="cyellow"> an object that takes up a 1x1 space </span>. An example of a block 
      would be say grass, dirt, etc.<br>
        Everything in the below image is a block, don&#39;t worry about the water just yet.<br>
        <br>
        <img src="https://i.ibb.co/TqZjJ4m/FBB40-ECF-D2-F9-476-D-B56-B-1-EAA3-C6-D5-E08.png" alt="grassblock", class="cntr"><br>
    </p>


    <h4 id="what-is-an-entity-">What is an entity?</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>An entity as I like to think of it is <span class="cyellow"> any object that is not fixed to it&#39;s position, and can take damage.</span><br>
        Water isn&#39;t fixed to it&#39;s position, is it an entity? No, the reason for that is because water cannot take damage.<br>
        <strong>All mobs, but not only mobs</strong> are entities.
        Below is an example of an entity.<br>
    </p>
    <p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/DGbPNgQ/Webp-net-resizeimage.png" alt="chicken.png" class="cntr"><br></p>
    <p><br>
        <br>
        Now that you know what entities and blocks are, that&#39;s a step forward.<br>
    </p>


    <h3 id="what-is-a-syntax-">What is a syntax?</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>A quick explanation I&#39;ll give about syntaxes is that they&#39;re the format of the 
      command, if your command doesn&#39;t<br>
        execute, then there&#39;s a chance it&#39;s that. <span class="cyellow"> Give all syntax errors a full read </span>, 
      if they don&#39;t work, take reference<br>
        from either my main guide or the <code>/help &lt;command-name&gt;</code> command while in game.<br>
        An example of a syntax error is: <code>/kill @ e</code>. That specific one will be raised 
      because there is a space between the<br>
        <code>@</code> and the <code>e</code>. We&#39;ll go deeper into these <code>@</code> things in a bit. Below is an example of a syntax error.<br>
        This most likely happened because the person didn&#39;t put an argument afterwards, 
      but don&#39;t worry too much.<br>
        <img src="https://i.ibb.co/y590bt1/D20-D2-B44-1-A2-E-4-DF9-BB91-9238320-F5-A4-C.jpg" alt="error example" class="cntr">
    </p>


    <h3 id="how-do-i-read-a-syntax-">How do I read a syntax?</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Here&#39;s a quick sumnary, it isn&#39;t really accurate (I personally don&#39;t read them and somehow know it):</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>&lt;text_here&gt;</code>. These brackets mean that this argument is <strong>required</strong>.</li>
        <li><code>[text_here]</code>. These brackets mean that this argument is <strong>optional</strong>.</li>
        <li>
            <code>(option1 | option2)</code>. These brackets mean that this argument <strong>must be one in the list</strong>.
            <h2 id="coordinate-management">Coordinate Management</h2>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <p>This is a crucial part in commands.</p>


    <h2 id="what-are-coordinates-">What are coordinates?</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>To put it in my way, coordinates are 
      really just the location of an object. But how do you know the coordinates?<br>
        How are coordinates formatted? Well, regarding both of them, there are three <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/axis">axes</a>, namely X, Y, and Z.<br>
        <strong>How are they formatted?</strong><br>
        The <span class="cyellow"> X and Y </span> axes should be clear, otherwise click on the hyperlink.<br>
        Things start on the <span class="cyellow"> Z axis </span>, that&#39;s what different, it&#39;s kind of like X,
      think of it as just another X, the reason<br>
        for the existence of the Z axis is because the game is in 3D, 
      don&#39;t worry too much about it for now.<br>
        <strong>How does one get the coordinates of an object?</strong><br>
        It&#39;s quite simple to do this, you <strong>do
      not need to teleport</strong> yourself. You can simply run this command:<br>
        <code>/gamerule showcoordinates true</code> and your 
      coordinates should show <strong>at the top left</strong>. 
      Once they&#39;re showing, read the numbers after<br>
        <code>Position</code>. It should look somewhat like this:
      <code>Position: X, Y, Z</code>. If it doesn&#39;t show exactly like that, don&#39;t panic.<br>
        X, Y, and Z are used to represent the number, whatever it is
        , is where your <span class="cyellow"> legs are </span>. We&#39;ll be getting into<br>
        <span class="cyellow">tildes </span> on the next section, they will be necessary.
    </p>


    <h3 id="what-are-tildes-">What are Tildes?</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Tildes are the <code>~</code> character, which in English means <strong>about</strong>, <strong>near</strong>, or <strong>here</strong>.<br>
        Same thing goes for coordinates in Minecraft.<br>
        Each tilde in a command represents from where the command is being executed, 
        and Math can be done on those.<br>
        To add to the coordinate: <code>~&lt;number&gt;</code>. This goes for all
        <span class="cyellow"> X, Y, and Z axes.</span><br>
        To remove from the coordinate: <code>~-&lt;number&gt;</code>. Note the <code>-</code>. This goes for all axes.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Say you want the player to teleport 10 blocks upwards, remember the <span class="cyellow">Y axis is vertical</span>.<br>
        <code>tp &lt;target&gt; ~ ~10 ~</code>.<br>
        Now what is <code>target</code> you may ask. Target means the
        entity the command is being executed on.<br>
        This command moves the player 10 blocks up from the command block if there is one, or the person who executed it.<br>
        Don&#39;t worry yet about making the player do it, we&#39;ll cover it now.<br>
    </p>


    <h2 id="entity-management">Entity Management</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Well this is a bad name for the section, but this section is for managing entities.<br>
        There are a lot of commands that can <span class="cyellow">affect entities,</span> but here I&#39;ll cover the crucial ones.<br>
    </p>


    <h3 id="deleting-an-entity">Deleting an Entity</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>It&#39;s very easy to delete an entity, you can simply use the <span class="cyellow">kill command to delete an entity</span>.<br>
        But what if you wanted to delete a dropped item, or perhaps a specific mob? Below is more info.<br>
    </p>


    <h3 id="targetting">Targetting</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>You can use the target selector argument, 
        which I will be specifying information about right here.<br>
        You can use the <code>@e</code> targetting, 
        but further than that is what we&#39;ll be focusing on.<br>
        <strong>@ Decorators</strong>
        No one calls them decorators other than me probably,
        so don&#39;t use that as terminology. Now<br>
        what are these? Well, I like to explain these as the main argument in selecting which entity to use.<br>
        A list of each one of them, and what they do is below:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>@p</code> This selects the nearest player from where the command was executed.</li>
        <li><code>@r</code> This selects a random player in the world who is online.</li>
        <li><code>@s</code> This selects the <strong>entity</strong> that executed the command.</li>
        <li><code>@a</code> This selects all the players.</li>
        <li><code>@e</code> This selects all entites.
            <code>@s</code> is one I just wanna talk a bit more about. It makes the entity that executed be executed on.<br>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, I want a creeper to say <code>Aww man</code> in the chat, I&#39;d use:<br>
        <code>execute @e[type=creeper,name=&quot;creep.er&quot;] ~ ~ ~ say Aww man</code>.<br>
        You see those things in the <code>[]</code> brackets? They will be covered next.<br>
    </p>
    <p><code>@e[type=&lt;entity_type&gt;</code> 
      will <span class="cyellow">select a specific type of entity, this could be TNT, a dropped item, a<br>
        specific mob type, etc, it can find any entity type.</span>
      But what if you wanted a specific entity?<br>
        <code>@e[type=&lt;entity_type&gt;,name=&lt;name&gt;</code>. With that, you&#39;ll find one of a name.<br>
        A very common issue I find others doing is when they&#39;re getting the name, they usually<br>
        forget to add quotes after the <code>=</code> sign.
      If the mob has a space in the name, simply<br>
        instead of <code>&lt;name&gt;</code>, imagine it becomes <code>&quot;&lt;name&gt;&quot;</code>.<br>
        The name may be ugly, and so here is an alternative, this is also a way to group entities.
        <code>/tag &lt;target&gt; (add | remove) &lt;name: 
          string&gt;</code>.<br>
        This will add a new group to the targetted entity, after adding it you can remove the name, if there is one.<br>
        Now <code>string</code> means to add quotes, 
      just like the name in the target selector.<br>
        You may want to check for the range, here&#39;s how:
        <code>@e[r=&lt;range number&gt;]</code><br>
        In most guides, <code>number</code> will be 
      represented as <code>int</code> or <code>integer</code>. They both mean a number.<br>
    </p>


    <h2 id="execute">Execute</h2>
    <hr>
    <p><strong>This is an extremely important section!</strong>
        This section is fully dedicated to making <span class="cyellow">entities execute a command</span>, think of it as <code>sudo</code>, but for commands.<br>
        The execute command is the <strong>most powerful</strong> command in the entire game, but don&#39;t worry, it isn&#39;t hard to<br>
        pick up on.
        <code>/execute &lt;target&gt; &lt;location&gt; &lt;selected command
          syntax&gt;</code> is the syntax. <code>&lt;selected command syntax&gt;</code><br>
        refers to the command you&#39;re getting the entity to execute. I always
        have my location as <code>~ ~ ~</code> and when it&#39;s<br>
        like that, it executes anywhere, that&#39;s at least what I use for myself.<br>
        But what if you wanted to check if someone was on a specific block type?<br>
        <code>/execute &lt;target&gt; &lt;location&gt; detect &lt;block to
        detect&gt; &lt;data value&gt; &lt;detectPos&gt; &lt;command&gt;</code>.<br>
        That would be your syntax. <code>detect</code> isn&#39;t in brackets, 
        this means to just put it there, regardless.<br>
        Say you wanted a creeper walking on grass to kill nearby ocelots, you&#39;d use this:
        <code>mcfunction
        /execute @e[type=creeper] ~ ~ ~ detect grass 0 ~ ~-1 ~ kill @e[type=ocelot,r=5]</code>
    </p>
    <p>Now that you&#39;ve gotten this far, I believe you&#39;re ready for my other guide,
      which has a contents panel.<br>
        Click <a href="https://gist.github.com/VideoCarp/eeaf915a2361d93f0fd8cf2c72d6db64">here</a>.<br>
        Also quick notice, use the power of effect, armor stands, tags and names.
