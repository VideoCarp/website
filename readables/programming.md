  <summary> Maths </summary>
  You might've heard that you need maths for programming. This is *kinda* true, but also not really.
  You need maths if you do AI or data science. But you don't need maths to make a website.
  There is some mathematical theory in programming, but it's not complex, so don't worry. The maths
  you need for programming depends on the subject, but in general, it's not hard.

# Why program?

Why should you program? This is the first important question to ask yourself. Are you interested in programming?
Perhaps you're a student? For work?
Whoever you are, programming is an enriching subject, that once understood, will be a useful or even fun tool to use. 
Programming may appear an impossible task, but don't let that affect you. It's just hard to get started. 


> ℹ️ Some subjects are very difficult in programming, but you'll find a lot are easy.

**The practical uses of programming:**
Programming is applicable in a variety of fields and sometimes you don't even know you're using a program.
Programming is used in engineering, medicine, science, software development and plenty of others.
In regards to what programming can achieve, the answer is ”anything.” 
Any task you can think of, that can happen, can be programmed. 
Websites, applications, operating systems and general appliances are or can be programmed. 
In short, programming is useful if you need to make something happen at a more abstracted level.
**Programming as a hobby:**
Programming can be a hobby, too. 
It can be a particularly enriching activity,
that will change your thinking for the better and help you understand things around you. 
It's not easy to describe it, but I'll also say is that it opens your mind.
# Programming basics
**Thinking programmatically:**
The first step to get into programming is to understand how to think about it. 
First off, a ”program” is a series of instructions to be executed by a computer.
