should be the correct map, read the <code>level_name.txt</code> file, if it has the correct name,<br>
Now, you would need to have some way of compressing and renaming files, renaming files should be covered for<br>
Windows and Android, for iOS, use iZip.<br>
it is the correct world. Now that you have the exact folder, and the correct apps you need for your map, follow this process:<br></p>
<ul>
<li>Compress the <strong><em>contents</em></strong> of the folder.
Zip the contents of the folder, not the folder itself, otherwise your .mcworld will fail to import.</li>
<li>Rename to <code>your_map&#39;s_name</code>
You don&#39;t need to make it match anything, just use plain text. Do not use <code>Â§eYellow</code> for example, it is unecessary and makes your installer look bad.</li>
<li>Change the zip file&#39;s extension to <code>.mcworld</code>
You&#39;ve got your compressed folder now set up. Try testing it!<br></li>
</ul>
